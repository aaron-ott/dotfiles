# Aaron's Dotfiles
Dotfiles for NeoVim (using LazyVim) and Alacritty

## Installation
Install dotfiles by creating the folders you want in `.config`:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
```

Then, run the script to push stuff to the configs

```
bash disperse.sh
```


## Making Changes
Once you've made changes to your local dotfiles, push them to the repo with
```
bash extract.sh
```
