Dotfiles for NeoVim (using LazyVim) and Alacritty

## Installation

Install dotfiles by creating the folders you want in `.config`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
```

Then, run the script to pull stuff into your configs

```bash
bash dotfiles.sh pull
```

## Making Changes

Once you've made changes to your local dotfiles, push them to the repo with

```bash
bash dotfiles.sh push
```
